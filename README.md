# Kubernetes Experiments

This folder contains various Kubernetes-related experiments, configurations, and test deployments. 
It serves as a sandbox environment where I explore and learn different Kubernetes features, patterns, and tools.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Document my learning and experimentation with Kubernetes
- Serve as a reference for setting up common K8s resources
- Test and iterate on different deployment strategies and tools

## Structure

Content will be organized by topic or experiment, with each subfolder including its own README where necessary.
